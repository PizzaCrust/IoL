# IoL
**Injected Orientated Loader** <br />
A dynamic and injected orientated plugin loader for Minecraft.
## Features

- All transformations are handled by PizzaMixin and Javassist to ensure the loader transforms classes as fast as possible.
- Programmatically, this can be upgraded to the next version of Minecraft by updating MixinDedicatedServer in two lines of code.
- Mappings are provided by the client, which can allow the user to use snapshots with IoL provided that they have mappings.
